I will review the provided script for security vulnerabilities. I will focus on identifying potential security issues in the code snippet related to Docker image building and handling.

## Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script uses user input ($_command) to execute commands without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially manipulate the $_command variable to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

## Severity: High

## A snippet of affected code:
```bash
_command="$1"
if [[ "$_command" == "publish" ]]; then
    # Vulnerable command execution without proper validation
    _push_images() {
        local _images=($1)
        for (( i=1; i<${#_images[@]}; i++ )) do
            docker push ${_images[i]}
        done
    }
    _push_images "$JUDGE0_PRODUCTION_IMAGES"
    _push_images "$JUDGE0_DEVELOPMENT_IMAGES"
fi
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate the command injection vulnerability, ensure that input variables like $_command are properly validated and sanitized before using them in command execution. Use strict validation checks, such as allowing only predefined commands or values that are known to be safe.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```bash
_command="$1"
# Validate the input command to prevent command injection
if [[ "$_command" == "publish" ]]; then
    if [[ "$JUDGE0_VERSION" == "" ]]; then
        _die "Cannot publish untagged version."
    fi
    _push_images() {
        local _images=($1)
        for (( i=1; i<${#_images[@]}; i++ )) do
            docker push "${_images[i]}"
        done
    }
    _push_images "$JUDGE0_PRODUCTION_IMAGES"
    _push_images "$JUDGE0_DEVELOPMENT_IMAGES"
fi
```

## PoC: N/A

Please ensure the strict validation of user input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities in your script.
